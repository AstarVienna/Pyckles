[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pyckles/badge/?version=latest)](https://pyckles.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Does nothing more than download a compiled FITS file with all the stellar spectra 
and allows the user to access these interactively with python

Documentation can be found at [Read the Docs](https://pyckles.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Update - more catalogues available!
Pyckles now allows you to access more than just the Pickles stellar spectra.

The following catalogues are available:
* Pickles (1998): Stellar spectra over [0.15, 2.5]um at 5nm resolution
* Brown (2014): Galaxy spectra over [0.01, 30]um at R~50
